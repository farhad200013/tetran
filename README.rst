Tetran Prereq
=============
Tetran works on Mac, Linux, Cygwin and Windows Subsystem for Linux.


Linux / WSL
------------

    sudo apt install gfortran libncurses-dev

Mac
----------

    brew install gcc ncurses

Cygwin
------

    setup-x86_64.exe -P libncurses-devel cmake make gcc-gfortran


Compile Tetran
==============
::

    cd bin
    cmake ..
    make

You can optionally specify a compiler by setting ``FC=``. 
For example, to use the Intel Fortran compiler::

    FC=ifort cmake ..
    make

Play
====
::

    ./tetran

The difficulty level may be set (rate of falling blocks higher) by::

    ./tetran 10

The first number sets the difficulty level (higher number more difficult; positive integers only.
This integer number is used to divide the wait time period by
